<h2>Project Title: AeroCrash using OpenGL</h2>
<h3>About Project</h3>
<p>The project AEROPLANE CRASH is created to demonstrate OpenGL’s concepts. It encompasses some of the skills learnt in our OpenGL classes such as pushmatrix(),translate(),popmatrix(),timer function</p>
<p>The SCOPE is to use the basic primitives defined in openGL library creating complex 
objects. We make use of different concepts such as pushmatrix(),translate() 
,popmatrix(),timer function.</p>

<h3>OpenGL</h3>
<p>OpenGL is the premier environment for developing portable, interactive 2D and 3D 
graphics applications. Since its introduction in 1992, OpenGL has become the industry's most 
widely used and supported 2D and 3D graphics application programming interface (API), 
bringing thousands of applications to a wide variety of computer platforms. </p>
<p>OpenGL runs on every major operating system including Mac OS, OS/2, UNIX, 
Windows 95/98, Windows 2000, Windows NT, Linux, Open Step, and BeOS; it also works 
with every major windowing system, including Win32, MacOS, Presentation Manager, and 
X-Window System. OpenGL is callable from Ada, C, C++, Fortran, Python, Perl and Java 
and offers complete independence from network protocols and topologies</p>
